                    <p><b>Wow!! I have a story</b></p>
                        It all begins in 2013, I was in planning mode. I had finished my degree and worked for couple of years when I decided to make that bold move to migrate to the United States from South London United Kingdom, at first, I was frighten Moving to a new country on my own. <p> With every last goodbye drawing my departure closer and closer, I tend to wonder why I was leaving everyone that ever loved me to go to a place where this people won’t be</p>
                        Before I left England, I knew I was extremely quick at finding patterns and at mental calculations, I was great at math’s, I loved maps, and charts, and graphs, but I could see no place where I could use these talents even though my first Degree was in manufacturing Engineering 
                       <p> On getting to the United States, I immediately enrolled at a university to do a master degree so I can follow my passion for Data because I strongly believe that data when organized and manipulated carefully, with a mix of the right technologies, can create a lot of impact on society. The specific courses I took like </p>

                        Visualization & Analytics: Tableau, Power BI, Advanced Excel, PowerPoint
                        Data Science Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, ScikitLearn, NLTK,Seaborn, Keras
                        Programming Frameworks: Jupyter Notebook
                        Machine Learning Skills: Classification, Regression, Clustering, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Reinforcement Learning, KNN, Naive Bayes, Hypothesis Testing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Time series analysis, Predictive and Prescriptive Data analysis
                        Soft Skills: Analytical Thinking, Team-player, Strategic decision making, Problem solver Leadership, Student development training. <p>These short courses enabled me to pick up basic coding skills and knowledge about data analytics. More importantly, I gained confidence in my ability to learn and started seeing the potential of data analytics beyond the industry I was familiar with. </p>
                        <img src="images/storytelling (2).png" alt="">
</p>My love for manipulating data through visualization and coding motivated me to join Xerox Services as a JR Data Analyst.  At Xerox I had a steady career graph and became a Data Analyst. Working on huge Data sets of Health care Clients in Xerox nourished the true enthusiasm in me to progress my career in the field of Data Analytics. Gaining enough experience and unleashing the team player skills in me from Xerox, I decided to take the next leap of my life by joining Bank of America, as a Data Analyst.</p>

                <p><b>Critical Thinking</b><br> I tend to understand data and expand its implications beyond the numbers alone. As a critical thinker, I think analytically about data by identifying their patterns and extracting actionable insights and information from the information I have in hand. I go above and beyond to apply myself to thinking, as opposed to only processing. 

                Being a critical thinker is difficult, but I hone such skills by challenging myself. When I am facing an analytical task or exercise, all I do is think and I try to know the meaning behind the pattern I see, 
                <br>What does the data say about what has been accomplished? 
                <br>what shortfalls does it indicate?

                    •	I scrape data from websites: Check out my codes in GitHub
                    <br>•	I Clean data: I take a dataset with missing, duplicate, or other problematic data, and walk through and use data cleaning process.
                    <br>•	I Perform different types of analysis: I use data to perform diagnostic, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis.
                    <br>•	I Visualize data to tell a story: I create a chart, map, graph, or other visualization to make my data easier to understand.
                    <br>•	I communicate complex ideas: Consider writing a blog post that outlines my process or explains a difficult data concept to highlight my communication skills.
                    <br>•	I collaborate with others: On different types of projects.
                    <br>•	I use data analysis tools:  Like- SQL, Python, R, power Bi, Machine Learning, Excel, Google Sheet, etc.
